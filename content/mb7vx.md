### Usage Instructions

When in range of MB7VX, send APRS packets on 144.800MHz.

To enable RF-to-RF communication locally, MB7VX may be used as a
digipeater. It will digipeat packets according to the "new n-N
Paradigm". In practice, this means that you should set your path to
include at least "WIDE2-1" or at most "WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1".

### Coverage

Reports are encouraged and should be sent to <irl@hambsd.org> with the
subject line "MB7VX Report".

### Station Details

#### Controller

While HamBSD matures, this station is currently controlled by the
firmware of the transceiver.

#### Transceiver

MB7VX uses a Kenwood TM-D700 as its transciever.

#### Antenna and Feeder

A resonant feedline dipole is installed on the roof of the building.

22 meters of RG58 coax is used to connect the antenna and the radio.

#### Internet Gateway

A fixed-line internet connection is available at this site, but is not
currently used.
