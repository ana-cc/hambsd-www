The following list outlines hardware that the HamBSD project could use.
There are a number of reasons why developers need hardware, and it is
important to first of all realize these reasons:

-   To support a specific device, normally one which is more rare or
    new.
-   To be part of their development environment.
-   Some of these devices may have quirks that require some
    investigation and workaround in order to function correctly.
-   That said, space or power may be at a premium for some people.

If you do not own these devices, but want to help us, we recommend you
search on [eBay][] for the devices. If you do the bidding and then get
the device shipped to us, it really helps us. It is better if developers
develop, and skip the bidding process, since any time saved can be spent
on improving HamBSD instead.

Some items are available in kit form. If you are happy to build and test
the kit before shipping it on to a developer, that can save some money
and provide a fun project too. If you enjoy building kits but don't
enjoy them sitting around unused afterwards, we can almost certainly
come to an arrangement.

Contact [Iain Learmonth][] who will be able to tell you if something is
useful, and if so, where to send it.

Please be very clear as to where you are located!! Unless an item is
particularly rare, it is probably uneconomical to ship from anywhere
outside Europe. (All development currently happens in *Scotland*.)

### General Requirements

-   Terminal Node Controllers (RS232 or USB)
-   Transcievers with built-in TNC (e.g. Kenwood TM-D700, TM-D710,
    TH-D72, TH-D74)
-   All-mode transcievers (e.g. FT-897, FT-857 and Icom 706)
-   RS232 protocol analyser

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TNC-X

It looks like the [TNC-X][] is quite popular and is readily available to
purchase. It would be great to have one of these available for
development in *Scotland*. If purchasing this new, it would be the
"Complete Wired and Tested TNC-X including USB and Enclosure" option
that is preferred to allow testing of both the serial port connection
and USB connection. Additionally, the "[5 Pin DIN to 6 Pin Mini-DIN
TNC/Radio Cable][]" would be required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dummy Loads

A couple dummy loads would be useful for supporting development and
testing in *Scotland*. They should have either SO-239 sockets, or for
units intended to plug directly onto the antenna socket, PL-259 plugs. A
power rating of 10-15W is entirely sufficient.
